## Assignments + Final Project for ECE176: Intro to Deep Learning and Applications

This is a project conducted for ECE176 at UCSD, WI24. 

*"This course covers the fundamentals in deep learning, basics in deep neural network including different network architectures (e.g., ConvNet, RNN), and the optimization algorithms for training these networks. We will have hands-on implementation courses in PyTorch. This course will also introduce the deep learning applications in computer vision, robotics, and sequence modeling in natural language processing."*

### Overview:
The final project utilizes and tests different neural network architecture, including more popular models like Resnet-18 and Densenet, as well as more customized CNN and multiscaled CNN models to determine the presence/type of brain tumor in MRI scans of human brains. The simple and multiscale CNN models seemed to far outperform Resnet-18 and Densenet, suggesting more simple models may be more ideal for performance while also reducing computational needs and costs.
